# Assignment 5 – Linked List Operations

This assignment contains multiple C++ programs that demonstrate different operations on singly linked lists. Each program focuses on a specific linked list concept.

## 1. Full Linked List Menu Program
A complete implementation allowing:
- Insert at beginning
- Insert at end
- Insert before a node
- Insert after a node
- Delete from beginning
- Delete from end
- Delete a specific node
- Search for a node
- Display the list

## 2. Count and Delete All Occurrences
This program:
- Inserts values at the end
- Counts how many times a given value appears
- Deletes all occurrences of that value
- Displays the updated list

## 3. Find the Middle of a Linked List
Uses the slow–fast pointer technique to find the middle element.

## 4. Reverse a Linked List
Reverses the linked list using pointer manipulation and displays the reversed output.

## How to Compile and Run
```
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```
