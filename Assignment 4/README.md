# Assignment 4 - Queue and Stack Implementations

This repository contains C++ programs for various queue and stack implementations as part of **Assignment 4**.

## Contents

1. **Queue using Array**
   - Implements basic queue operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Check if Empty, Check if Full, Display, Peek.

2. **Circular Queue**
   - Implements circular queue with array, supports enqueue, dequeue, display, and peek.

3. **Interleaving Queue**
   - Interleaves the first half of the queue with the second half.
   - Works only with an even number of elements.

4. **First Non-Repeating Character in a Stream**
   - Program to print the first non-repeating character at each step while reading a stream of characters.

5. **Stack Implementations using Queues**
   - **a) Stack using Two Queues**
   - **b) Stack using One Queue**

## How to Compile and Run

1. Save the desired program (e.g., `queue.cpp`) from this assignment.
2. Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to the file location.
3. Compile using:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```

## Notes
- Ensure that you provide valid input where required.
- For the interleaving queue program, enter only an **even number** of elements.
- Programs are menu-driven where applicable.
