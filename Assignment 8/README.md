# Assignment 8 – Trees and Heaps  
This README summarizes all the programs included in **Assignment 8**.  
It covers tree traversals, BST operations, depth calculations, BST validation, heaps, and priority queues.

---

## 1. Tree Traversals  
Implements **Pre‑order**, **In‑order**, and **Post‑order** traversals on a binary tree.  
Code includes node structure and traversal functions.

## 2. Binary Search Tree Operations

### 2(a) Recursive Search  
A recursive implementation of searching an element inside a BST.

### 2(a) Non‑Recursive Search  
Iterative approach to find a key inside a BST.

### 2(b,c) Find Minimum and Maximum  
Functions to return the smallest and largest values in a BST.

### 2(d,e) In‑order Successor & Predecessor  
Computes the next and previous node in BST in‑order sequence.

---

## 3. BST Menu Program  
Features:  
- Insert node  
- Delete node  
- Display (In‑order)  
- Find maximum depth  
- Find minimum depth  

Includes full menu‑driven implementation.

---

## 4. Check if a Tree is a BST  
Validates a binary tree by ensuring all nodes satisfy the BST property using min‑max bounds.

---

## 5. Heap Implementation  
Max‑heap with operations:  
- Insert  
- Delete max  
- Percolate down  
- Dynamic resizing  
- Heap sort  

---

## 6. Priority Queue Using Heap  
Implements a max‑priority queue built on top of heap structure.

---

## How to Run  
1. Copy each program into a separate `.cpp` file.  
2. Compile using:
   ```
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ```
3. Run:
   ```
   ./output
   ```
